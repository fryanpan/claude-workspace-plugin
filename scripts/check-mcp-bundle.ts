/**
 * The MCP bundle-drift gate.
 *
 * Peers load `packages/plugin/mcp/index.js`, not the TypeScript under
 * `packages/mcp/src`. An edit to the source that never reaches the committed
 * bundle ships nothing, and the session that loads it reports success — which
 * is the failure mode this gate exists for.
 *
 * The check is a rebuild plus a diff: build the bundle from today's source and
 * fail if the tracked artifact moved. It does NOT revert the rebuild. The fix
 * is to commit what the build produced, so leaving it in the working tree is
 * the fix already half-applied; reverting would hide it.
 *
 * This used to be eight lines of inline shell in .github/workflows/ci.yml. It
 * is a script so that CI and `bun run verify` run the SAME check rather than
 * two hand-copied versions of it.
