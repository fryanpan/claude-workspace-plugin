/**
 * The CallTool dispatcher: what every `tools/call` request runs through
 * before, and after, the domain handler that answers it.
 *
 * Four things happen around the answer and each is load-bearing. The deferred
 * emitter is opened first and released in a `finally`, so a throwing handler
 * still lets the held channel frames out. The watch restore runs before
 * anything else, because a respawned child's first tool call is the moment
 * its set has to be back. The heartbeat is fire-and-forget, because liveness
 * is not worth failing a call over. And the auto-watch fires before the
 * handler, so a doc named in a call is subscribed even if the caller forgot.
 * A fifth is smaller and newer: a call that arrives under a tool's
 * pre-rename name is answered normally and noted once in the log.
 *
 * Lifted out of `mcp.ts` unchanged. The three domain families arrive as a
 * list rather than three named imports: the chain is the shape here, and the
 * last link — the answer for a name nobody claims — is what the switch's
 * `default` became.
