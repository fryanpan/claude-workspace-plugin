/**
 * This session's proof that it is the agent it says it is.
 *
 * `/api/agents/<id>/watches` and `/events/agent/<id>` are keyed on an agent
 * id that is `agentIdForName(name)` -- a hash of a name written on the board
 * in plain sight -- so knowing a peer's name was enough to open their whole
 * event feed. The server now wants a bearer on both, and this is the client
 * half: ask the server once for a token for THIS process's agent id, hold
 * it, and put it on every call.
 *
 * Three properties worth stating, because each one is a failure this avoids.
 *
 * 1. **Never fatal, never final.** A server that predates the mint route
 *    answers 404, and a server on the far side of a restart may answer
 *    anything at all. Every failure resolves to "no header" for THAT call,
 *    and the next call asks again. It used to remember a 404 for the life of
 *    the process, which on a current server meant one bad answer -- a restart
 *    window, a request that reached the wrong listener -- left the session
 *    tokenless until it restarted. With `CW_REQUIRE_AGENT_TOKEN` on, that is
 *    a session locked out of its own feed.
 * 2. **Single-flight.** The first watch, the restore, and the stream open
 *    within milliseconds of each other at session start. Without this they
 *    are three mint calls racing; with it they await one.
 * 3. **Forgettable.** The token is an HMAC under a key on the server's disk,
 *    so rotating that key invalidates it. `forget()` drops the cached value
 *    on the server's own "this token does not speak for you" refusal, and
 *    the next call mints a fresh one rather than retrying a dead value for
 *    the life of the session.
 *
 * The shared identity (`known-agent`, which is what an unset `CW_AGENT_NAME`
 * resolves to) gets no token: the server refuses to mint one, because a
 * token over an id every anonymous session shares is a token all of them
 * hold. Those sessions were already outside the durable-watch and mux paths
 * for the same reason.

 * That was the wrong trade. It made the very first tool call of a session
 * wait on a mint that has nothing to do with it -- coupling every tool's
