/**
 * The inside view of a session's own coverage.
 *
 * The measured incident: a peer held six docs under `watch_doc` and believed
 * it was listening. It had never attached to the board those docs live on. A
 * voice note queued SILENTLY, and every probe the
 * agent could run answered confidently — `list_watched_docs` said six watches,
 * all live. Six watches IS the true answer to the question that probe asks.
 * It is the wrong question.
 *
 * The server now answers the right one on `GET /api/agents/:id/watches`
 * (`coverage`). This module is the half that makes the answer reach somebody:
 * it reads that block without ever inventing one, and turns it into the line
 * a respawned session gets unprompted. Unprompted is the whole point — an
 * agent that does not know the gap exists never runs the probe that would
 * show it.
 *
 * It lives beside mcp.ts rather than inside it for the reason author.ts,
 * frame-dedup.ts and declare-lead.ts do: mcp.ts ends in a top-level
 * `await server.connect(transport)` and exports nothing, so a test can only
 * read its source — and source-reading cannot check what a sentence says.
