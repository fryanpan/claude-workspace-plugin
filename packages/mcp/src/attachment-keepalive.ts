/**
 * Keep this session's attachments live while it is working.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Attaching is not a state, it is a claim that lapses unless
 * the server keeps SEEING this session: `hasLiveAttachment` /
 * `hasLiveLeadAttachment` ask whether observed work — `max(lastHeartbeat,
 * lastToolCallAt)` — is inside the observed window AND a channel is open, and
 * every lead-addressed delivery is gated on them. The server only observes
 * what reaches IT, so an agent editing files, thinking, or working a
 * different board is invisible here however busy it is. The one thing that
 * refreshed the claim was an agent remembering to call the `heartbeat` tool,
 * and nothing in this process ever did it automatically. So the documented
 * happy path — "declare yourself lead at session start and you are done" —
 * let a working agent lapse on every board it was not actively touching, at
 * which point Bryan's next goal edit queues with no channel emit and the
 * session hears exactly the silence this ticket is about.
 *
 * It also keeps the DISPLAYED state honest, which is a separate and shorter
 * clock: the active/away label a person reads on the board is heartbeat-only,
 * so without this a plainly working agent renders as away long before any
 * delivery is actually at risk.
 *
 * WHY PIGGYBACK ON TOOL CALLS rather than a timer. The heartbeat means "this
 * agent is alive AND working" — the route stamps `lastToolCallAt` from it,
 * and a fresh heartbeat with an old tool call is what renders as "process up,
 * agent unresponsive". A timer would keep asserting liveness through a wedged
 * session and destroy exactly that distinction. A tool call is the honest
 * signal, it is frequent (an agent doing anything makes many), and it costs
 * one small POST per board per interval.
 *
 * This module is the decision half only — which boards are due — so it can be
 * tested against a clock. The sending lives in mcp.ts.
