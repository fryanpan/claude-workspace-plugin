/**
 * How a `voice.request` event reads to the agent that receives it.
 *
 * The row rides the per-workspace channel every attached agent hears, and for
 * as long as the fast path could only NAVIGATE there were exactly two things
 * one could be: a lookup the server already answered (drop it — nothing
 * happened and nothing is pending), or an utterance that needs judgment
 * (render the imperative, "act on it through the task/edit tools").
 *
 * `fast-path-action` is a third thing, and the old two-way rendering gets it
 * wrong in the dangerous direction. The board ALREADY MOVED — the server set
 * the status, reassigned the row, posted the comment, answered the review
 * item — and the imperative describes all of that as work still to do. For a
 * status change a second application is caught by `same-status`; for an
 * assignee it is not, and for a spoken comment it posts the same words twice
 * under the speaker's name.
 *
 * So the row must still be DELIVERED (it is the one voice row an agent most
 * needs to see: something changed on its board that it did not do) while
 * saying the opposite thing about what to do with it.
 *
 * Kept out of mcp.ts — which exports nothing, being a bundle entry point —
 * for the same reason `nudge-line.ts` is: the wording is a decision, and
 * inline in a 3,000-line switch it is untestable. Composed from the
 * payload's `route`, `transcript`, `ack` and `context`, plus `meeting` on a
 * request asked in a meeting, which the visitor's drop-list also drops.
