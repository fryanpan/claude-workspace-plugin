/**
 * How the coach's frames read to the coach session that receives them.
 *
 * The server sends the Coach board's lead what the owner read, wrote and
 * commented as one digest per 15-minute window (`coach.digest`; a single
 * `coach.event` still reads, for a server from before digests), how they
 * answered a moment (`coach.answer`), and how readily they want the coach to
 * speak up (`coach.preference`). The session stays quiet unless an event
 * plainly matches a goal, and speaks through `coach_moment`; what to do with
 * each line is the `claude-workspaces:coaching` skill. A digest ends with
 * this week's plan goals in plan order, or says there is no current plan.
 *
 * Kept out of channel-messages.ts for the reason voice-line.ts is: the
 * wording is a decision, and this is where a test can read it.
