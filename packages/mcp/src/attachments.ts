/**
 * This session's attachments: proving them live, and reading who else is on a
 * row before it claims one.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Attaching is not a state, it is a claim that lapses unless
 * the server keeps SEEING this session, and every lead-addressed delivery is
 * gated on that. An agent editing files, thinking, or working a different
 * board is invisible here however busy it is — so the heartbeat rides real
 * tool calls, which is the honest signal that this agent is alive AND
 * working. The decision half (which boards are due) is
 * `attachment-keepalive.ts`; this is the sending half, which is what could
 * not be driven while it lived in `mcp.ts`.
 *
 * Neither call here ever throws. A keepalive that could fail a tool call
 * would be worse than the staleness it prevents, and a claim warning that
 * could fail a claim would be worse than the collision it prevents.
