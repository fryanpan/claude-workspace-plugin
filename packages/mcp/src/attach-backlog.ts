/**
 * Deliver the backlog half of an attach response whose body no tool call
 * reads.
 *
 * Three attach sites hand `queuedComments` (and `queuedVoice`) straight back
 * to the session as a tool result — `attach_agent`, `set_workspace_lead`,
 * and the heartbeat's SSE frames. The FOURTH site is `ensureWatchesRestored`,
 * the re-attach a respawned session runs on its own, and it is the one that
 * fires precisely in the failure mode this queue exists for (stream down,
 * process restarted). Its POST has no tool response to ride: before this
 * module the server drained the backlog into a body nobody read — voice rows
 * destructively (gone), comment rows marked emitted (suppressed for a full
 * grace window while the agent that just came back heard nothing).
 *
 * So the respawn delivery goes out as CHANNEL notifications — the same
 * rendering an SSE frame would have gotten — and each comment row is acked
 * only AFTER its emit succeeded, the same order `handleFrame` keeps and for
 * the same reason: an ack sent first clears the durable copy on the strength
 * of an intent.
 *
 * Lives outside mcp.ts because that file is a bundle entry point and exports
 * nothing, so ordering (emit before ack) and skip rules would otherwise be
 * untestable. Fixtures in the test are synthetic; the repo is public.
