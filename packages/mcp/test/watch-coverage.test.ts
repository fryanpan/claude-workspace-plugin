/**
 * The inside view: can this session tell whether it is actually covered?
 *
 * The server now answers that on the watches route. This is the half that
 * makes the answer reach somebody — a report nobody reads is the same failure
 * as no report. Two surfaces:
 *
 *  - `list_watched_docs` carries the server's `coverage` block through
 *    verbatim, beside the watching / persistence / restore fields it already
 *    reports, so the probe an agent already runs stops answering only the
 *    easy question.
 *  - the restore notice — the one line a respawned session gets unprompted —
 *    names any unattached board with something WAITING on it. Unprompted is
 *    the point: an agent that does not know to ask never runs the probe.
 *
 * The silence rules are as load-bearing as the alarms and are pinned as
 * positive controls: nothing is ever fabricated when the server did not send
 * a coverage block, and a board with nothing queued raises nothing. An alarm
 * that fires on the innocent case is how a real one stops being read.
 *
 * Fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
