/**
 * An open ask that no longer applies, read off its thread.
 *
 * Bryan, 2026-10-07: "Why are there invalid review items still on my board
 * from text that's been orphaned and is no longer needed?" An item was
 * anchored on a mock's button; the agent removed the button and said so on
 * the thread, and the item stayed on Home. Two rules decide it, both read
 * from the thread as it stands, so an item filed before this existed is
 * judged the same way and nothing is rewritten:
 *
 *  - **orphaned** — the thread's anchor is orphaned: the words or element it
 *    was about are gone from the doc. A re-anchor brings the ask back.
 *  - **settled** — a LATER comment by the asker itself, carrying no
 *    declaration of its own, says the ask is moot ("this is no longer
 *    needed", "never mind"), or says something was removed in a sentence
 *    that names a word of the ask's headline or names it by a pronoun ("I
 *    removed it") (`settlesAsk`). Only the
 *    asker's own words count: a person replying is answering, which is a
 *    different exit.
 *
 * The item is not destroyed. Its words stay on the thread, marked as no
 * longer asked, and the queue stops carrying it. The asker is told once, so it
 * can withdraw the item or file a fresh one.
 *
 * `settlesAsk` is a narrow phrase rule, not a model, so it can be tested and
 * costs nothing per reply. Progress on something else ("the retry error is
 * now fixed") never matches: a moot phrase must name the ask, and a removal
 * must share a word with its headline or name its object by a pronoun ("I
 * removed it") — on the asker's own thread the pronoun is the ask's subject.
 * An offer to redo the work later ("I'll do that only if you want it") does
 * not block; a question mark does, and so does a negation ahead of the
 * removal words in their sentence ("I don't think I deleted it"). What it
 * misses: a paraphrase outside its phrases ("the button's gone", "all
 * sorted"), a removal that a negation happens to precede ("No, I removed
 * it"), a bare "done", work done rather than removed, a settling reply from a different agent, and an
 * anchor the server never marks orphaned (an element removed from a mock is
 * found missing by the widget, not the server). What it can wrongly catch: a
 * removal of something else that happens to share a headline word, or that
 * the asker names only as "it", in a reply with no question mark and no
 * "still need".
