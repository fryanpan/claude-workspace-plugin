/**
 * Our own write-back, still on the pool, is not an outside change.
 *
 * Rapid edits to a bound doc (an agent's find-and-replace run, a burst of
 * accepted suggestions) arm the next write-back while the previous one is
 * still on the thread pool. That write's rename has landed but its callback,
 * which records the new mtime and `lastWritten`, has not run. The next flush's
 * mtime guard used to stat the file at that moment, see a stamp it did not
 * record, and reconcile: disk held our own previous write, the live doc held
 * one edit more, so the conflict arm backed up our own bytes as "external"
 * and logged a disk↔doc conflict.
 *
 * The pool write is held open after its rename by wrapping `boundFiles.write`,
 * the same seam `bound-write-lane.test.ts` uses. Every test restores it.
 *
 * Names and contents are invented.
