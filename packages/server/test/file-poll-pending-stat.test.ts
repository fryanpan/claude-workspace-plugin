/**
 * The file poll keeps the loop, and the other docs, moving while one bound
 * file's stat has not answered.
 *
 * Prod's `[loop] blocked` lines named `file-poll` on hourly blocks of 1–4.7s
 * with little CPU, at a time of day when the host's disk is slow. The poll's
 * stat has been on the thread pool since PR 682, so these tests pin what that
 * buys rather than rebuild it: while one file's stat is held pending, the
 * sweep keeps running, another doc's external edit still arrives, the loop
 * keeps turning, and the held file is stat'd once rather than once a tick.
 * The edit to the held file arrives as soon as its stat answers.
 *
 * The stat is held through `boundFiles.useStatForTests`, which replaces the
 * one syscall `statMtime` makes. Nothing else about the poll is stubbed.
 *
 * Mutation controls, run by hand: deleting the `statInFlight` guard in
 * `pollBinding` fails the once-only count (the held file reaches 2+ pending
 * stats); making the sweep skip its whole tick while any stat is in flight
 * fails it too, because the held file reaches its deadline before the
 * healthy one is stat'd again.
 *
 * Every fixture is invented.
