/**
 * "Claude, …" said in a bot meeting: a one-line spoken answer into the call,
 * and a minute in the meeting's notes only when the answer is worth keeping
 * (`minuteFor`).
 *
 * Two rules decide whether anything happens, and both fail closed:
 *
 *  - THE WAKE PHRASE opens the utterance: "Claude," or "Hey Claude," with a
 *    pause mark after it, then the request. The transcriber writes the pause
 *    as a comma, so "Claude's notes say…", "Claudia, …" and "Cloud, …" are
 *    not addressed to anyone, and neither is "Claude" said mid-sentence.
 *  - THE OWNER ASKS. A speaker is the owner only when Recall's participant
 *    email matches the server's owner email (`CW_OWNER_EMAIL`). A display
 *    name never counts: anyone in a call can rename themselves, and two
 *    people can share a name. No email on the participant, or no owner email
 *    configured, is silence.
 *
 * Claude never speaks unprompted, so a final turn that fails either rule
 * returns before anything is read, and nothing here runs on a timer.
 *
 * The answer comes from the board's own answerer (`spoken-reply/answer.ts`),
 * the one setups 1 to 4 use, so a meeting hears what the board mic would
 * say. Only its first sentence is said, in at most `MEETING_SPOKEN_MAX_WORDS`
 * words. A minute is written before the voice is tried, so a voice that
 * fails still leaves it.
 *
 * Asked as a page's microphone meeting asks (`spoken-reply/meeting-ask.ts`):
 * with the meeting doc's notes and what the call said in the two minutes
 * before the request (`voice-meeting-context.ts`), fenced as untrusted. What
 * the router hands to the lead is acknowledged ("On it.") and the lead's
 * answer is said into the call when it arrives, once the bot is not already
 * speaking, with its minute written by the same `minuteFor` rule
 * (`spoken-reply/meeting-errands.ts`).
