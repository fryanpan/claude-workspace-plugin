/**
 * Which door may record an answer on a `secret` or `grant` item.
 *
 * Both shapes are answered by something other than words: a secret by the
 * values form, which stores them and records only their names; a grant by the
 * owner's Approve, which writes their settings. Any other door that records
 * text on one is a leak (a spoken or typed value lands in the feed) or a lie
 * (a grant card closed with nothing written). The routes refuse early, before
 * their own writes; this is the check in the store underneath them, so a door
 * added later — voice was one — is refused without having to remember.

/**
 * What every FREE-TEXT answer door says to a secret ask.
 *
 * The shape's whole claim is that a value reaches the store and nothing else.
 * An answer recorded as words is the opposite of that in every particular: it
 * is written onto the item, into the task file, into the events log and into
 * the activity feed, it is read back by the asking agent, and it closes the
 * ask so nobody comes looking. A surface that renders this item as an ordinary
 * question — and one did, on the task page — hands the reader a box that does
 * all of that with a real value in it.
 *
 * So the refusal lives at the doors and in the store beneath them, not in the
 * card. A card can be got wrong on one surface and right on another; a door
 * cannot. It names the route
 * that does take the values, because the caller refused here is either a
 * person's browser on a surface that has not caught up or an agent that read
 * the wrong tool, and both need to be sent somewhere rather than stopped.
