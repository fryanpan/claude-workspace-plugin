 * written, not on what it has got round to committing.
 *
 * The baseline below pins COMMITTED history only, and this reads to the
 * working tree: a worktree handed on while the last occupant's edits were
 * still uncommitted attributes them to whoever holds it now. Committing
 * before the handover is what the registry's own dispatch flow does; a
 * baseline cannot reach work that has no commit.
 *
 * `since` narrows it to one stretch of that branch's life: pass the commit a
 * worktree was sitting on when its CURRENT occupant took it, and the read
 * stops attributing the previous occupant's work to this one. It is used only
 * when it is both a descendant of the merge base and an ancestor of HEAD —
 * so a recorded commit that has been rebased away, or that belongs to a
 * branch this worktree has since left, falls back to the merge base rather
 * than producing a diff about nothing.
 *

 * client tree changed a file a person looks at, and a list holding only the
 * destination says the opposite of what happened.
 *

 * branch, no merge base, a git that failed. It is deliberately a different
 * value from `{ files: [] }` ("a readable worktree that has changed nothing"), because
