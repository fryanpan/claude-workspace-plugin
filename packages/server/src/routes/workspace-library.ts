/**
 * The board's Library over HTTP: the list behind the Library page, and the
 * one verb that opens a project file nobody has bound yet.
 *
 *   GET  /workspaces/<id>/library/items — meetings and files, newest first
 *   POST /workspaces/<id>/library/open  — `{ path }` → `{ docId, href }`
 *
 * The list is on `shareScopeAllows`, and a share visitor's list is a
 * different build: only what is FILED on the board — its docs, mocks, apps
 * and meetings, each opening at an address on the board — with no project,
 * no repo file nobody filed and no mount, because those name files on this
 * machine rather than content on the board (`visitorSources`). Before this, a
 * member who opened the Library tab was refused its data and read "The
 * library could not load". `open` is not on the allowlist and refuses a share
 * visitor itself as well: it binds a file on this machine.
 *
 * **What `open` may bind.** A page may not name a host path — binding is an
 * agent action for exactly that reason (`browserCannotBindBody`). This verb
 * takes a path RELATIVE to a root the server chose, and binds it only when the
 * server's own Library listing for this board offers it: a markdown file that
 * `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard` lists, or a markdown file
 * in the project's mounts. Anything else is `not-listed`, whether or not it
 * exists, because whether a hidden file exists is itself what must not be told.
 * A symlink inside the root that points outside it is refused after the
 * lexical check, the way `openContextFile` refuses one.
 *
 * A path the listing found through a MOUNT resolves through that mount
 * (`resolveFile`), never by joining it to the project root: a mount records
 * the checkout its bytes came from, which may be a worktree the root is not,
 * and the same relative path in the other checkout is a different file.
