/**
 * THE GRANT DOOR — the one route on this server that writes the owner's
 * Claude Code user settings, and it only ever appends the allow lines a
 * `grant` card listed.
 *
 * `POST /workspaces/<ws>/tasks/<id>/review-items/<item>/grant` with
 * `{ decision: 'approve' | 'decline', allowRules: [...] }`. Approve writes
 * the lines (`permission-grants.ts`) and records the answer; Decline records
 * the answer and writes nothing. Either closes the card.
 *
 * THE ORDER OF THE REFUSALS IS THE SECURITY PROPERTY, as on the secrets door
 * beside it:
 *  1. The task must be on the path's board (404 otherwise, as for a task
 *     that does not exist), and the item must be a grant card — the shape,
 *     not a flag, decides.
 *  2. `refuseOwnerOnlyWrite`, asked about the TASK's board: a share or
 *     collab visitor is refused (the route is also absent from the host
 *     guard's member allowlist, so none reaches it at all).
 *  3. A PERSON PROOF naming the owner — the Cloudflare Access email or the
 *     signed session cookie, resolved by `provenIdentityFor`. `requireOwner`
 *     alone is not enough here: it passes every loopback caller, and every
 *     agent and MCP child on this machine is one. A body's claimed author is
 *     never read for this, and neither is a widget popup token (the widget
 *     never renders a grant card) nor an agent token. So an agent can file
 *     the card and cannot approve it.
 *  4. The request came from the board's own page: `Sec-Fetch-Site:
 *     same-origin` and an `Origin` equal to this server's own. The
 *     cross-origin write gate admits a dev server on any local port, and a
 *     session cookie is same-site with it, so without this a page an agent
 *     wrote could press Approve for a signed-in owner.
 *  5. After the body is read, from a fresh read: for an Approve, the task
 *     is still open (its lines would be written after the close released
 *     it, and stay until the next boot); the card is still open; and the
 *     store would record the answer.
 *  6. The lines the browser was SHOWING must equal the lines stored. A card
 *     reworded between render and tap is refused, so the owner approves
 *     exactly what they read.
 * Only then is the settings file touched, and a refused write (the file does
 * not parse, it changed underfoot) leaves the card open with the reason.
 * Nothing between step 5 and the answer awaits, so the answer cannot be
 * refused after the lines are written.
