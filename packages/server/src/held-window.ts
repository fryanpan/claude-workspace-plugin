/**
 * A window that holds what arrives and hands it over in one batch.
 *
 * Every frame an agent receives is a session turn, so a feed that sends one
 * frame per event costs one turn per event (the coach measured 86 turns in
 * five hours with nothing said). The first item opens a window; when the
 * window closes, everything it held goes out together. A quiet stretch opens
 * no window and sends nothing.
 *
 * Two feeds use it: the coach session's digest (`coach/session-feed.ts`) and
 * the plan lead's new-asks feed (`ask-feed.ts`). The clock and the timer are
 * injected so a test moves time by hand.
