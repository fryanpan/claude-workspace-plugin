/**
 * Keeping the one thread that runs JavaScript answerable — and saying so when
 * it was not.
 *
 * This server is single-threaded. A handler that runs to completion without
 * awaiting holds every other request behind it, including the supervisor's
 * health probe, and the supervisor's answer to an unanswered probe is to
 * restart the process. So an unyielded pass is not a slow route: it is an
 * outage plus a restart.
 *
 * On 2026-09-16 prod stopped answering :8787 twice. The evidence that it was
 * the loop and not the handlers is that the requests which returned late did
 * no work at all: `GET /events/d-…` took 56,016 ms and returned **404**; eight
 * `GET /api/calendar/events` took 12,973–14,427 ms and returned **403**; eight
 * `GET /events/*` took 14,763–14,934 ms and returned **401**, all landing
 * within 171 ms of each other. A 401 cannot take fourteen seconds to compute.
 * Those requests sat in the accept queue while nothing ran them, and they came
 * out together when the loop was handed back — a drained queue, not slow code.
 *
 * The first episode's blocker is named: health checks failed at 14:49:52,
 * 14:50:22, 14:50:53 and 14:51:22, and immediately after the fourth,
 * `POST …/suggestions/resolve_all` logged **114,650 ms**. The next request took
 * 553 ms. The server recovered the instant that handler returned.
 *
 * That one is fixed at its source (`DocEditOps.resolveAllSuggestions` now
 * yields). This module exists because finding it cost a day of reading a log
 * that never said "blocked" — the only trace a wedge leaves today is that some
 * 404 took a minute, and you have to already suspect it to notice. Two pieces:
 *
 *   - {@link LoopLagMonitor} watches for the gap a blocked turn leaves in its
 *     own schedule, and reports it with whatever was in flight at the time —
 *     requests, and the named background passes ({@link backgroundPasses}).
 *   - {@link timeSlice} is what a long pass uses to stay answerable, so the
 *     next unbounded loop has a house pattern to reach for instead of
 *     inventing one.
 *
 * **The monitor answers a question the log could not.** A stall where a request
 * was in flight is a synchronous pass in that handler. A stall where NOTHING
 * was in flight is a timer callback, a garbage collection, or the OS
 * descheduling a process on a swapping machine — a different fault with a
 * different fix. Those two are indistinguishable in today's log, and the line
 * this module writes separates them.
