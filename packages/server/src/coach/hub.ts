/**
 * The coach's own event stream, `GET /coach/stream`: the moment, to every
 * page the owner has open, and its clearing once he answers it in any of them.
 *
 * Its own stream rather than a board channel because a board channel
 * reaches every member of that board, and a moment is his alone. It carries
 * nothing else, so a page holding it learns only what the coach says.
 *
 * A page that connects while a moment is open gets it at once, wherever it
 * is, and one that connects with none open is told so, so a card it drew
 * before he answered elsewhere goes. A moment follows him to every page until
 * he answers it in any one. Each page says where it is when it connects
 * (`?workspaceId=&docId=`; the front page names nowhere), and the moment a
 * page on a board the coach is excluded from is sent says `off`, so the card
 * there says the coach is not listening rather than offering to stop it.
 * Showing the card there sends nothing about the board to the session. When a
 * board becomes off or on again, `reshow` tells each page anew.
 *
 * Writes go through `createSseStreamWriter`, like every other stream here,
 * for the macOS hold that file explains.
