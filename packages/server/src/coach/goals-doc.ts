/**
 * The learning-goals doc: the template the coach starts it from, and the
 * reading of it the coach judges against.
 *
 * The doc is filled in by the planning interview (`spoken-reply/
 * interview.ts`): tap Talk on the doc and it asks about each empty section
 * and writes the spoken answer under its heading. So the template is only
 * headings. The interview asks the most important empty section first,
 * scoring heading words like "goals" and "why" above the rest, so every
 * heading here avoids those words: with equal scores it asks in the doc's
 * order, and the coach's name comes first.
 *
 * The goals live in one section, "What I want to do better". Each top-level
 * bullet (with its sub-bullets) or paragraph there is one goal, and carries
 * its own trigger: "If I spend more than an hour on X, ask me Y." He asked
 * for no more structure than that (the owner, 2026-10-05).
 *
 * Docs made before that have one `##` section per goal with four `###`
 * parts. They still read: every "What I want to do better" item is a goal,
 * with its section's "Act differently when" joined to it, and a section
 * with only a trigger is a goal of its own.
