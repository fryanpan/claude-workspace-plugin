/**
 * One window of what the owner did, as the coach session reads it.
 *
 * Every event used to be a session turn of its own, and a session that
 * posted nothing still spent 86 turns and 9.7M tokens in five hours. So the
 * feed (`coach/session-feed.ts`) holds a window's events and hands them here
 * once. A run of views in one place becomes that place and the minutes he
 * spent there, with the headings he passed; the passage in view is dropped.
 * What he wrote, commented and replied keeps its words, because a trigger
 * is often about exactly that.
 *
 * Pure: the caller hands in the events and when the window closed.
