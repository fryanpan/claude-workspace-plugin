/**
 * Workflow A's first step: "Set up my coach" makes the learning-goals doc
 * and the coach's memory doc, once each, on a board of the coach's own.
 *
 * The doc is an ordinary markdown doc bound to `<dataDir>/coach/
 * learning-goals.md`, so it has comments, history and the voice interview
 * like any other. Its board is named "Coach" and is created here, unshared,
 * so the doc sits on no board anybody else works in.
 *
 * The memory doc, `<dataDir>/coach/memory.md`, is the coach session's own:
 * what it has learned about when to speak and when not to, which it reads
 * when it starts and writes as it learns, so a restart keeps it. A board set
 * up before the memory doc existed gets one at boot (`wiring.ts`).
 *
 * Idempotent: a second setup returns the docs the first made while they
 * still exist. An existing file is never overwritten.
