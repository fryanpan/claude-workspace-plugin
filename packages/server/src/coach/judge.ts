/**
 * The server's check on a moment the coach session raises.
 *
 * The session decides when to speak; this decides whether what it sent may
 * reach his page. QUIET BY DEFAULT: models asked when to coach step in far
 * too often (in MetaCLASS, arXiv 2602.02457, they stayed quiet in 4% of the
 * cases where quiet was right in 42%). So a moment must name one goal AND
 * quote words from it, and the quote is checked here against the goal's own
 * text. He writes each goal with its trigger in it ("If I spend more than an
 * hour on X, ask me Y"), so the words a moment can quote are the moment he
 * named. Anything else is refused, with the reason, so the session can see
 * why.
