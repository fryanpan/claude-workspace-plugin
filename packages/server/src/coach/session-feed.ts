/**
 * The coach session's feed: every event, as it happens, to the Claude Code
 * session that is the coach (the owner, 2026-10-03: "routing all events to a
 * long running Claude Code session ... that can hold an ongoing
 * conversation with context").
 *
 * The session is the lead of the Coach board, launched once and kept
 * running all week by the fleet's respawn. Each frame is one addressed
 * frame to it on that board: what he did in the last window
 * (`coach.digest`), how he answered a moment (`coach.answer`), and how
 * readily he wants it to speak up (`coach.preference`). The session decides
 * whether to speak, and raises a moment through `POST /coach/moments`;
 * nothing here waits on it.
 *
 * Every frame is a session turn, and one turn per event cost 86 turns and
 * 9.7M tokens in five hours with nothing said. So what he does is held: the
 * first event opens a window, and when it closes 15 minutes later the
 * window goes as one digest (`coach/digest.ts`). A quiet stretch opens no
 * window and sends nothing. His answers and his setting go at once. Each
 * digest also carries this week's plan goals in plan order
 * (`coach/week-plan.ts`), so the session ranks by the plan, not by titles,
 * and his Claude Code time per attached session (`coach/session-minutes.ts`).
 * A counted turn end opens a window as a board event does: terminal work
 * with no board page open is the case that section exists for.
 *
 * A day has a budget of turns (`DAILY_EVENT_LIMIT`): past it nothing is
 * sent until his next local day, and the front page says the coach is
 * paused.
 *
 * With no lead, or a lead holding no stream, nothing is sent: an addressed
 * frame is replayed to a stream that comes back, so a session that is gone
 * would otherwise read a backlog of stale events when it returns.
