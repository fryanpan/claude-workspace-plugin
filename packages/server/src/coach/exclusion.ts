/**
 * Which boards the coach never hears from.
 *
 * The coach session reads what the owner reads and writes, and sends it to
 * the Anthropic API. Some boards must never go there: a client's board, a
 * board shared with someone else, a family member's records. So a board is
 * off when any of these holds, and an event on it is not sent at all, not
 * even the board's title:
 *
 *  - it, or a doc on it, keeps its files on this machine (`local-only`, the
 *    attachment-set and project privacy);
 *  - its sharing lock is on;
 *  - anyone besides the owner can reach it: a member, a share, a link;
 *  - he turned the coach off for it ("Coach off for this board").
 *
 * A doc is off when it is local-only itself or any board holding it is off.
 * A check that throws counts as off: the question is what may leave the
 * machine, and "could not tell" is not a yes.
