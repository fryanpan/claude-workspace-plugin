/**
 * An open folder review hears a file created, deleted or renamed on disk.
 *
 * A review's file list is a disk scan, and nothing told an open page that
 * the disk moved: a file an agent wrote, a `git checkout`, an editor's new
 * file reached the tree only when the window regained focus. This watches
 * the folder for exactly as long as a page holds the review's stream
 * (`ws~<setId>`), and on a settled burst re-reconciles the review the way a
 * refresh does (`refreshWorkspace`), whose `onSetRescanned` sends the
 * `attachments.changed` frame the page already re-reads on
 * (`page-nudges.ts`, `workspaces-app/src/set-live.ts`).
 *
 * The rules, each from a way this has gone wrong before:
 *
 *   - ONLY WHAT A PAGE HAS OPEN. A watch starts on a channel's first page
 *     stream and closes with its last. Agent streams do not count: an agent
 *     never draws a tree. One watch per folder however many pages hold it,
 *     and at most `MAX_WATCHED_FOLDERS` in all.
 *   - DIRECTORY ENTRIES, NEVER CONTENTS. The trigger is one recursive
 *     `fs.watch` on the root (FSEvents on macOS: one stream per folder, not
 *     a handle per file). What an event meant is decided from a LISTING —
 *     `git ls-files` as a child process, or outside a repo an async
 *     `readdir` walk — both names only, both off the main thread, inside a
 *     deadline. Nothing here opens a file, so an online-only cloud file
 *     cannot answer EDEADLK or hang a read here.
 *   - A BURST IS ONE PASS. Events only mark the folder dirty. A pass runs
 *     after `SETTLE_MS` of quiet or `MAX_WAIT_MS` since the first event,
 *     and a pass in flight makes the next wait for it, so a `git checkout`
 *     of hundreds of files is one listing and at most one refresh.
 *   - A SAVE IS NOT NEWS. Editors save by renaming a temp file over the old
 *     one, which a directory watch reports like a new file. So the pass
 *     compares its listing with the last pass's and refreshes only when they
 *     differ: a file created, deleted or renamed. The first pass after a
 *     watch starts always refreshes, because the listing it would compare
 *     against may already hold a file whose event had not yet arrived.
 *   - A DIFF REVIEW LISTS ITS DIFF. A review based on the working tree also
 *     draws each file's +/- counts, and a tracked file's first edit joins it
 *     without changing `git ls-files`. So its listing is the diff itself —
 *     `git diff --numstat` against the stored base, one entry per file with
 *     its status and counts — and a save that moves a count is news, while
 *     one that writes the same bytes is not. Still git as child processes,
 *     still names and numbers only, still inside the deadline.
 *   - A DIFF IS CHECKED WHEN A PAGE OPENS IT. Its rows are stored, so an
 *     edit made while nobody had it open would otherwise be drawn stale
 *     until the next event. Its watch starts from the listing the stored
 *     rows describe and runs one pass at once; it refreshes only if the
 *     diff moved.
 *
 * `fs.watch` is the wrong tool for following one FILE's contents
 * (learnings.md, "fs.watch is the wrong primitive"); a recursive directory
 * watch that only asks "did the listing change" is the use it is good for.
