/**
 * Recall.ai — the vendor that puts a bot in a Zoom or Google Meet call.
 *
 * PROTOCOL, CONFIRMED FROM THE DOCS rather than remembered (read 2026-08-30):
 *
 *  - `POST https://<region>.recall.ai/api/v1/bot/` creates a bot for a
 *    `meeting_url`. The key travels in the `Authorization` header with NO
 *    `Bearer` prefix — the same shape AssemblyAI uses, and for the same
 *    reason a reviewer should not "fix" it.
 *    (docs.recall.ai/docs/bot_create, /reference/bot_retrieve)
 *  - The REGION IS THE HOSTNAME. There is no region field in the body, and a
 *    key issued for one region is not valid at another
 *    (docs.recall.ai/docs/regions). Four hosts exist; `RECALL_REGION` picks.
 *  - `recording_config.realtime_endpoints[]` is how data leaves Recall while
 *    the meeting is live. `type: "websocket"` means RECALL DIALS US: the URL
 *    must be reachable from the public internet, which is the one thing this
 *    server is not by default. See `publicWsBase` below.
 *    (docs.recall.ai/docs/real-time-websocket-endpoints)
 *  - `recording_config.transcript.provider.assembly_ai_v3_streaming` runs
 *    AssemblyAI Universal Streaming — the SAME engine `transcribe-assemblyai.ts`
 *    speaks to directly — inside Recall, and returns `transcript.data` events
 *    carrying the platform's own participant name. The AssemblyAI key for
 *    THAT path lives in the Recall dashboard for the matching region, not in
 *    this request and not in this repo; the Keychain key still serves the
 *    browser-microphone path. Use `assembly_ai_v3_streaming`, never the older
 *    `assembly_ai_streaming`, which the docs say fails.
 *    (docs.recall.ai/docs/assemblyai, /docs/dsdk-realtime-transcription)
 *  - `recording_config.retention` is `{type:"timed",hours:N}` (min 1, default
 *    168) or `{type:"forever"}`; `null` is zero-data-retention.
 *    (docs.recall.ai/docs/data-retention)
 *  - Zoom's NATIVE recording consent is not a create-time flag. The bot joins,
 *    and `POST /api/v1/bot/{id}/request_recording_permission/` asks the host —
 *    which is what makes Zoom's own banner fire. The answer arrives as the
 *    `bot.recording_permission_allowed` / `_denied` status events, and
 *    `automatic_leave.recording_permission_denied_timeout` is what stops a
 *    refused bot from sitting in the call billing.
 *    (docs.recall.ai/reference/bot_request_recording_permission_create)
 *
 * `fetch` is injected for the same reason the AssemblyAI socket is: a test of
 * this mapping must not reach the vendor, and this one spends money per bot.
