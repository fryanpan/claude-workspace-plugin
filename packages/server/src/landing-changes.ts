/**
 * The workspaces list's change feed: one frame telling an open `/` that what
 * it drew is stale.
 *
 * `/` is server-rendered from every board at once — the review bar and its
 * goal sections, each board's row, its last activity — so an open page has
 * no single board stream to follow, and a browser cannot hold one stream per
 * board: HTTP/1.1 allows six connections per host, and an owner has more
 * boards than that.
 * So the server listens to every broadcast, keeps the ones that can change
 * what `/` shows, and sends `landing.changed` on one channel. The page
 * refetches `/` and swaps the parts it drew (`landing-live.ts`), the house
 * pattern `landing-coach.ts` already uses after an answer.
 *
 * What counts is decided by event name, never by payload, so the filter
 * reads no board content. A board channel (`ws~<id>`) carries task, goal,
 * review-item and decision events; a doc channel counts only for a thread
 * event, since an ask is a thread. Agent presence, heartbeats, receipts and
 * meeting traffic change nothing on `/` and would only spend a re-render.
 *
 * Bursts coalesce: the first counted event arms a timer and the frame goes
 * out when it fires, so an agent filing ten tasks in a loop costs one
 * refetch per open page, not ten.
 *
 * The frame names the PARTS of `/` the burst touched, so the page re-reads
 * only those. `boards` is everything a board broadcast reaches (the review
 * bar and the board list); the coach, Incoming Messages and the meeting
 * banner have stores of their own that broadcast nothing, and their writers
 * call `notify` with their part. `/review` listens on the same channel and
 * re-reads its queue on `boards`.
