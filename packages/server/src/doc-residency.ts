/**
 * Which idle docs leave memory: the eviction WINDOWS, apart from the holds.
 *
 * Every resident doc is heap the garbage collector walks. Measured on
 * 2026-09-29 over 2,700 synthetic docs: 169MB of JS heap and 3.4M objects,
 * about 62KB per doc and linear in the count (300 docs: 25MB; 1,000: 67MB).
 * A full collection over that heap took 38-61ms on a machine with memory to
 * spare. Prod's idle blocks of 2.4-2.7s came with ~290MB free under swap,
 * where the heap of an idle process is exactly the memory macOS pages out
 * first, and the next full collection has to page every one of it back in.
 * So the lever is how many docs are resident, and this file is the rule
 * that decides it.
 *
 * Two windows, and it is Bryan's rule (2026-09-29, reversing "leave it" on
 * the old two-day window): a doc a PERSON opened stays for up to a week, if
 * memory allows; anything else — an agent's read or edit, a threads listing,
 * a fan-out — gets the short window. "A person opened it" is a live editor
 * socket leaving the doc (while it is open, the connection holds the doc);
 * agents reach docs over HTTP and never open one.
 *
 * "If memory allows" is a count: at most {@link PERSON_KEEP_CAP} docs hold
 * the week, the ones a person was in most recently. A doc past the cap falls
 * back to the short window, never below it, so no doc anybody reached in the
 * last {@link SHORT_KEEP_MS} is evicted to satisfy the number.
