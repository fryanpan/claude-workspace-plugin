/**
 * Deploy readiness (plan §3.12 commit 11): uptime measured from the
 * per-workspace events.jsonl audit log, against the 99% availability target
 * (goal 4.4 — "the board is up when you pull out your phone").
 *
 * The log is the substrate: every event line is proof the server was alive
 * at that instant, so downtime is a GAP analysis — any silence wider than
 * the tick grace means the process was down (or unable to write, which for
 * a board you can't reach amounts to the same thing). Real store events alone
 * can't carry this — an idle workspace emits nothing for hours — so the
 * UptimeMonitor appends a periodic `server.tick` marker as a liveness
 * floor, plus one `server.started` at boot so a restart bounds the outage
 * it just ended.
 *
 * Markers deliberately do NOT go through TaskStore.emit: §3.6's event table
 * is the exhaustive subscriber contract and has no server.* rows — ticks
 * are measurement substrate, not workspace activity, so nothing should be
 * broadcast to SSE watchers or MCP channels for them. They are appended
 * straight to the same events.jsonl the audit trail lives in, and the
 * events route strips `server.tick` back out of the activity list while
 * feeding every line's timestamp into the analysis. `server.started` stays
 * visible — a restart is honest activity worth a row.
