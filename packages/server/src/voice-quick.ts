 *
 *  - open a task, doc or mockup from a loose description (the router's title
 *    index, `voice.ts`);
 *  - go somewhere, including another board ("take me to the Riverbend
 *    board"), which is `boardAsk` here;
 *  - start a plan or a meeting (`startAsk`), the board's own two buttons;
 *  - leave feedback about the app (`feedbackAsk`), onto the one doc every
 *    board's feedback widget writes to;
 *  - say what voice can do (`helpAsk`).
 *
 * Everything else is a request for the lead agent. The detectors here catch
 * the common phrasings with no model; the choice classifier
 * (`voice-choice.ts`) offers the same actions as options, so a looser
 * phrasing is matched by meaning.
 *
 * Every ack here is six words or fewer and never says how it was routed: the
 * page already shows what was heard, and what happened is the whole reply.
