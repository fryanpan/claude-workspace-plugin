/**
 * Which spoken points are worth a note, and the note's written wording.
 *
 * A note is the part of the answer worth keeping on the page after the voice
 * has gone: something waiting on the listener, or a change the board just
 * made. Counts, "nothing waiting on you" and lists of what is in progress are
 * said and not noted — the board already shows them, and a note for every
 * sentence would be no emphasis at all.
 *
 * The wording is for reading, so it may differ from what is said: the
 * sentence's full stop goes, the count moves into brackets, and what the
 * listener has to act on comes first.
