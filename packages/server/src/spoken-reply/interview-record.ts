/**
 * A planning-voice run as `interview.ts` holds it, and the rows it leaves in
 * the interview log (`interview-log.ts`): one per answer, one per settled
 * question, and one when the run ends.
 *
 * IN A MEETING THE RUN ENDS WITH THE MEETING. Off a meeting a run is one
 * stretch of questions, and its end row is written when it stops. In a
 * planning meeting the voice asks one question, reads again at the next
 * pause, and may ask another an hour later, so a run per question would log
 * the voice as done after its first answer while the meeting is still
 * recording. There, every run's counts go into one tally, and its end row is
 * written once, when the socket goes (`InterviewRecord.close`).
