/**
 * "Claude, …" said in a meeting recorded from the page's own microphone (or
 * microphone plus Mac audio): the same wake phrase and owner rule a Recall
 * bot meeting uses (`meeting-claude.ts`), answered through the page's
 * spoken-reply socket rather than into a call. Nothing is written into the
 * meeting's notes unless the answer holds a minute (`minuteFor`).
 *
 * WHO ASKED. A bot meeting knows each speaker's email; a mic meeting knows
 * only the page. So the speaker is the person signed in on the page that
 * opened the socket, and only when the socket's own person proof — the
 * Cloudflare Access email or the signed session cookie, never a display
 * name, a body's claim, a widget token or an agent token — resolves to an
 * owner id (`isOwnerActor({ id })`, the check the grant door makes). That is
 * decided once, at the upgrade (`routes/upgrade-stream.ts`), and arrives
 * here as `owner`.
 *
 * WHOSE WORDS. A Mac-audio meeting also carries everybody dialled in, on the
 * `system` stream. Those words can never form a request: `own` holds only
 * what the page's microphone heard, and the wake phrase is looked for there.
 *
 * Fails closed like the bot path: no wake phrase, or not the owner, and
 * nothing is said or written.
 *
 * IN A PLANNING MEETING, "Claude, any questions?" is the planning voice's.
 * Asking the meeting's own assistant for its questions is asking for the
 * plan's open ones, so it goes to the interview as an invitation
 * (`SpokenAnswerer.invite`), never to the board router, which answered
 * Bryan's with a board status brief. Any other "Claude, …" still goes to the
 * router, and a discussion meeting is unchanged.
 *
 * SAID SHORT. Whoever answers — the router, the lead, the planning voice —
 * the meeting hears one sentence of at most `MEETING_SPOKEN_MAX_WORDS`
 * words (`meetingLine`).
 *
 * ASKED WITH THE MEETING. The router and the lead get the meeting's notes and
 * the room's last two minutes with the request (`MeetingRoom.recent`), so
 * "do you have enough to create tasks?" is about this meeting. Anyone in the
 * room can speak, so both are fenced as untrusted content.
 *
 * ANYTHING A SESSION CAN DO. A "Claude, …" is not narrowed to lookups here:
 * the router decides, and what it hands to the lead ("On it.") is worked on
 * while the meeting goes on, its answer said at a later pause
 * (`meeting-errands.ts`).
