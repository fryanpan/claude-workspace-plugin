/**
 * What of the router's answer is said, and what is only written.
 *
 * The plan's first rule is "say less, write more": the voice gives the
 * headline and the question, and the page carries the rest. The router
 * (`voice.ts`) answers in prose built for reading — "Heard: …", then the
 * answer, often several sentences — so this cuts it in two:
 *
 *  - a QUESTION is said on its own. "Did you mean A or B? Say first or
 *    second…" speaks the first sentence and writes the second, so a
 *    follow-up is one spoken question and then silence.
 *  - anything else speaks its first two sentences. When a status brief has a
 *    "Waiting on you" sentence, that one is the second: what changed, then
 *    what needs you.
 *
 * `SPOKEN_MAX_WORDS` is the hard cap under both rules, cut on a word
 * boundary, because a runaway sentence read aloud costs far more than one
 * left on the screen.
 *
 * The spoken part is also kept sentence by sentence (`says`), because each
 * sentence is a point that may carry a note (`notes.ts`), and its audio is
 * made separately so the note can land as that point starts.
