/**
 * The planning voice: with voice on in a plan, the person just talks, and at
 * each pause the agent asks about the plan's next open question, most
 * important first, and writes each spoken answer into the section it is
 * about. "Interview me" still starts it by name; it no longer has to.
 *
 * One per spoken-reply socket, held by its `SpokenAnswerer`, which asks this
 * first. On a doc on the socket's board every turn is this module's: the
 * first pause begins the run, and the socket's session ends each turn only
 * at a confirmed pause (`pause-gate.ts`), so a question never cuts into a
 * sentence. After each answer it does one of three things, logged as
 * `after-answer`:
 *
 *  - `edit`: the answer is written under its heading, and the next question
 *    is asked at once, since the person has just paused;
 *  - `follow-up`: a bare "yes" or "maybe" says nothing yet, so it asks once
 *    for more;
 *  - `quiet`: "I don't know yet", or a second bare answer: it says nothing,
 *    puts the question back in the queue, and asks its next one at the next
 *    pause.
 *
 * WHILE IT ASKS, its cursor is on the words it means — the open question as
 * written, or the heading — in every open view of the doc
 * (`InterviewDocs.focus`, the doc's presence; `doc/agent-focus.ts` scrolls
 * each page there and highlights them).
 *
 * THE WRITE is `DocStore.applyBlockEdits` with `insert_under_heading`, the
 * MCP block tools' verb: an ordinary edit of the live doc, so threads keep
 * their anchors and the bound file gets it at the next write-back.
 *
 * QUESTIONS COME FROM READING THE PLAN when the server has a model: at a
 * pause somebody spoke into, one call (`interview-reader.ts`) names the one
 * question worth asking now, or none, the gap list among its inputs. "Any
 * questions?" always gets an answer: the best question, or one sentence on
 * why there is none. Without a model, or at a silent pause, the gap list is
 * asked in order. In a planning meeting the notes' copy of an answer is held
 * while the question is out (`InterviewDocs.hold`, `meeting-ears.ts`), and
 * nothing is asked unprompted in its first minute (`MeetingWarmup`).
 *
 * THE DOC is the one the page says it is on, accepted only after
 * `InterviewDocs.onBoard` confirms it belongs to this socket's board — the
 * same membership check the router makes, because the page's context is
 * only clamped, never trusted, before it gets here.
