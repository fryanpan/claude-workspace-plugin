/**
 * What an interview hears as a command rather than an answer.
 *
 * Whole-utterance matches only, after the wake word and filler are off: an
 * answer that happens to contain "skip" ("we skip the staging deploy") is an
 * answer, and is written. That is why every pattern is anchored at both ends.
 *
 *  - `start`: "interview me", and the ways of saying it.
 *  - `skip`: move to the next gap and leave this one.
 *  - `later`: "come back to that" — the gap goes to the end of the queue.
 *  - `enough`: "that's enough" — the interview ends, and what was written stays.
 *  - `repeat`: "say that again" — the same question, asked again.
 *  - `unsure`: "I don't know yet" — no answer and no reason to press for
 *    one, so the planning voice says nothing and asks its next question at
 *    the next pause.
