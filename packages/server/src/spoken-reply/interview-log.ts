/**
 * How long each section took to fill in interview mode — the number the voice
 * plan compares against plans written by hand ("minutes per filled section").
 *
 * One row per gap the interview finished with, in two places:
 *
 *  - a log line, `[interview] doc=… section=N kind=… outcome=filled ms=…`,
 *    and one more when the interview ends with the minutes per filled section;
 *  - `<dataDir>/interview-timings.jsonl`, one JSON row per gap and one per
 *    interview's end, so the numbers survive a restart.
 *
 * `ms` runs from the moment the question was asked (the reply carrying it
 * left the server) to the moment the answer was written into the doc. A row
 * carries the doc's id, the section's place among its headings and counts —
 * never a heading, a question or an answer, so the file holds no doc content.
