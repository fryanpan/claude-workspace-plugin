/**
 * Incoming Messages answers the keyboard on a loaded front page: `j` then
 * `o` opens the next line, `?` shows the key list as a dialog that takes no
 * room in the section, and `e` removes a line into the Removed fold.
 *
 * `inbox-keys-driver.ts` boots a server with fixture rows, opens `/` through
 * the owner's Access door in headless Chromium, and presses real keys. This
 * file asserts on what it read.
 *
 * WHAT IT COULD NOT REPRODUCE. Bryan's report was from an iPad. On this page
 * as it stood, Chromium and WebKit both moved and opened on `j`/`o` once the
 * page had loaded; the one difference found is that nothing held focus at
 * load (`document.activeElement` was `<body>`), and Safari never focuses a
 * tapped button. So the section now takes focus itself, and the first case
 * asserts that.
 *
 * audit: no-text — the driver reads a running page; nothing here reads a
 * source file, a bundle or a stylesheet.
