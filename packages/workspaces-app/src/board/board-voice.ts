/**
 * The board's microphone: where an utterance lands.
 *
 * One responsibility, and it is the anchoring rather than the capture —
 * `voice-capture.ts` owns the hold-to-talk mechanics for every surface. What
 * is here is the board's answer to "what is this person talking ABOUT", which
 * has to be re-derived at the moment they press rather than at boot: the open
 * task panel, or the row their keyboard focus is on, plus the review item the
 * panel is aimed at so "pick the second one" answers THAT one.
 *
 * Exactly ONE capture may be mounted per page — Space is a singleton and two
 * captures would both claim it — so this is a mount, called once from boot,
 * not a render.
 *
 * `BoardVoiceDeps` is the whole list of what the mic may reach.
