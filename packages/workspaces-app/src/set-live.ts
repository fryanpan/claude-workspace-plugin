/**
 * Keep a review's sidebar — the diff file list, the folder tree, the doc-set
 * nav — current while it is open.
 *
 * The server sends `attachments.changed` on the set's own channel whenever a
 * row in its listing moves (a file joins, leaves, is renamed, or gains or
 * loses an open thread; `packages/server/src/page-nudges.ts`). The frame names
 * nothing, so the sidebar re-reads through the same gated route that drew it.
 * This replaced a 30s poll, which showed a change up to 30s late and asked
 * every 30s whether anything had.
 *
 * Files written straight to disk reach this frame too: while this stream is
 * open the server watches the set's folder (`server/src/folder-watch.ts`).
 *
 * Two more re-reads cover what the stream cannot: the window regaining focus
 * (kept from the poll's day — it also covers a folder the server could not
 * watch: past its cap, or a root it cannot open), and the stream reopening
 * after a drop, when frames sent in the gap are gone because none is replayed.
