# Launcher for the bundled MCP server.
#
# Why this exists: .mcp.json used to say `"command": "node"`, which only works
# when node happens to be on the launching process's PATH. On a machine where
# node comes from nvm, PATH is set up in ~/.zshrc — so it exists in an
# interactive shell and nowhere else. Sessions started any other way (launchd,
# a GUI app, cron, a non-login shell) died with a bare
#
#     Connection failed (ENOENT): Executable not found in $PATH: "node"
#
# and from inside the session the workspace tools were simply absent. Reconnecting
# doesn't help — it reuses the config the session already resolved.
#
# /bin/sh is the one interpreter guaranteed to be present, so it does the
# resolution itself instead of trusting the inherited environment.
#
# Usage: /bin/sh claude-workspaces-mcp.sh <path-to-mcp/index.js> [args...]
