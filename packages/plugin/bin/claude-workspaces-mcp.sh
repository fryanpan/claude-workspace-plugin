#!/bin/sh
# Launcher for the bundled MCP server.
#
# Why this exists: .mcp.json used to say `"command": "node"`, which only works
# when node happens to be on the launching process's PATH. On a machine where
# node comes from nvm, PATH is set up in ~/.zshrc — so it exists in an
# interactive shell and nowhere else. Sessions started any other way (launchd,
# a GUI app, cron, a non-login shell) died with a bare
#
#     Connection failed (ENOENT): Executable not found in $PATH: "node"
#
# and from inside the session the workspace tools were simply absent. Reconnecting
# doesn't help — it reuses the config the session already resolved.
#
# /bin/sh is the one interpreter guaranteed to be present, so it does the
# resolution itself instead of trusting the inherited environment.
#
# WHICH CHILD. The session's child is a relay by default: it carries MCP
# between the session and the server's hosted connector at /mcp, and holds no
# connector of its own (packages/mcp/src/relay/relay-core.ts says why and how).
# In order of preference:
#
#   1. The compiled relay: relay/relay.swift, built on THIS machine by
#      /usr/bin/swiftc into a per-user cache keyed by the source's hash. No
#      binary is ever shipped. The first launch of a new version builds it
#      (6s measured on an M-series Mac) while any other launch waits for that build, up to 20s. A
#      build that fails, or a cached binary that no longer runs, is never
#      exec'd: it has to pass `--self-test` first.
#   2. The node relay, mcp/relay.js, wherever there is no working build —
#      Linux, a Mac without the command line tools, a failed build.
#   3. The full child, mcp/index.js — today's connector in-process — when
#      CW_MCP_RELAY=0 (the rollback lever), or when an identity value is not
#      plain ASCII and so cannot travel as an HTTP header.
#
# Usage: /bin/sh claude-workspaces-mcp.sh <path-to-mcp/index.js> [args...]
