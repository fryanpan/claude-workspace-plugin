# Building a mock

A mock exists so a person can act on it and comment on it. Each step leaves a proof.

**First:** call `read_project_conventions(<any path in the repo>)`. A `## Workflow: building-a-mock` section there adds steps; do them where it says.

## Steps

1. **Start from the real surface.** For a change to an existing screen, copy its served markup and its own stylesheets, then change the copy. Later rounds edit the file the mock serves from. *Check (manual):* every stylesheet in the file is the app's own, linked by its served path.
2. **Make every state reachable by acting on the page.** *Check (manual):* reach each state the task names in the rendered page by tapping or typing (a CDP click, headless). Captioned scenes fail.
3. **Serve it, and render it as the reader sees it.** `attach_mockup` on the first round only; later, a reload shows your edit. Then run:

   ```bash
   node <this skill's base directory>/check-mock-render.mjs --url <mock URL> --out <dir>
   ```

   `<mock URL>` is the path `attach_mockup` returned, on the board's local address (such as `http://127.0.0.1:8787`); a public hostname gives a sign-in page. It renders 1900x1200, 1180x820 and 430x932 in throwaway headless Chrome, and exits 1 when the widget is missing or hidden, or the page scrolls sideways at 430. Get exit 0, then look at the screenshots. Needs Node 22+ and Chrome (`--chrome <path>`).
4. **Run a UX walk in a subagent**, using the `ux-review` skill as `qa-delegate` describes (team-lead-fleet). Give it the URL, persona and states. A severe finding goes back to step 2.
5. **Hand off.** **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `claude-workspaces:handing-off-for-review`. Answer on the reader's existing thread on the mock and revise your existing item ("Keep one place to work together" in `claude-workspaces:working-in-a-workspace`). Widget details: `claude-workspaces:embedding-widget`.

## Done criteria this workflow adds to the task

| Criterion | Proof |
| --- | --- |
| Uses the surface's own stylesheets | The stylesheet paths |
| Every named state reachable by acting | Each state and its action |
| Render check exits 0 | Its JSON line and screenshots |
| UX walk found nothing severe | The subagent's report |
| Handed off | The review item |

## Red flags

| Thought | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| "No time for the render check" | It takes 30 seconds; a mock with no widget costs a round. |
| "A local screenshot, `observe_url` or a curl 200 proves it" | Only the served route has the widget; `observe_url` is an event stream; any id answers 200. |
| "I'll do the UX pass myself" | A builder can't sign off their own work. |
